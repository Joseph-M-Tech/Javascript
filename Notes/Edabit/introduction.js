1. // use keywords for declaring variables
    const varName = variable;
    let varName1 = variable1;
    // `var` is not common after ES6 
// 2. _____________Operators_______________
/**
 * Operators are the symbols between values that allow different operations like
 *  addition +, subtraction -, multiplication *,
 *  division (/),modulus %, exponentiation **, increment ++, decrement --,
 */
/*
/**
 * _______________concatenation___________________
 * Use the + operator to concatenate (combine) two strings together.
 
        const firstName = "Luke "
        const lastName = "Skywalker"

        // enter code below this line
        const name = firstName + lastName;
 
______________Dot Notation________________
If you want to access the lastName of person3, you would return person3.lastName. 
This is called dot notation because it uses a . to specify the key you want to access.


_________________Functions_______________
 Functions are blocks of code that can be named and reused. They are given data,
 do something specific with the data, and return a result.
 Although functions usually take parameters, they don't necessarily have to.
This is what a basic function looks like:

        function addTwoNumbers(num1, num2) {
        return num1 + num2
        }
Can you guess what it does? Let's look at each part:

`addTwoNumbers` is the name of the function.
`num1` and `num2` are parameters (i.e. variables containing input data).
`return` is the keyword that exits the function and returns a value (output).
Using the "return" keyword is very important. When you encounter a function, 
you must return your answer, otherwise the code won't work.
