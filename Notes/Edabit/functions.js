_________________Functions_______________
 Functions are blocks of code that can be named and reused. They are given data,
 do something specific with the data, and return a result.
 Although functions usually take parameters, they don't necessarily have to.
This is what a basic function looks like:

        function addTwoNumbers(num1, num2) {
        return num1 + num2
        }
Can you guess what it does? Let's look at each part:

`addTwoNumbers` is the name of the function.
`num1` and `num2` are parameters (i.e. variables containing input data).
`return` is the keyword that exits the function and returns a value (output).
Using the "return" keyword is very important. When you encounter a function, 
you must return your answer, otherwise the code won't work.
